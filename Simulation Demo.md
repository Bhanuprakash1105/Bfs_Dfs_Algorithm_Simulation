### After opening the "index.html" file in the browser you can observe as shown in below image

### Now click on any cicles (choose any two white points) the first selected will be colored BLUE and second selected circle will be RED colored
### Blue colored circle indicates the starting point and Red colored circle indicates the ending point

### Now click on either "DFS" or "BFS" for running the search algorithm
### Search Algorithm starts from Blue colored circle and finds the Red colored circle
### After finding the Red Circle the color of RED circle is changed to VIOLET as show in below image
### _(In the image shown below, DFS was choosen)_

### After running a search algorithm use RESET button for reseting the start and end points for running more searches

### Below are few more images of the simulation
