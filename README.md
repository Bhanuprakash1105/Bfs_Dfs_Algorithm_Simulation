# Bfs_Dfs_Algorithm_Simulation
### Breadth-First Search and Depth First Search Algorithms Simulation using Javascript HTML Canvas 

### Open the "index.html" in the browser to start the simulation

### Make sure that "index.html", "script.js" and "style.css" all the files are present in the same folder. 

### After opening the "index.html" file in the browser you can observe the page similar to the image shown below

### Now click on any circles (choose any two white points) the first selected will be colored BLUE and the second selected circle will be RED colored
### Blue colored circle indicates the starting point and Red-colored circle indicates the ending point

### Now click on either "DFS" or "BFS" for running the search algorithm
### Search Algorithm starts from the Blue colored circle and finds the Red-colored circle
### After finding the Red Circle the color of the RED circle is changed to VIOLET as shown in the below image
### _(In the image shown below, DFS was chosen)_

### After running a search algorithm use the RESET button for resetting the start and endpoints for running more searches

### _Note that the number of circles, the size of buttons, and the font size will change dynamically with respect to the browser window size as shown in the below two images_
